           - If approved, update loans table status to 'approved' or From False to True depends on my supabase Schema structure and features and record approved_at and approved_by
           - If rejected, update loans table status to 'rejected' and save rejection reason

3. Integration & Backend API:
   - Fetch loans, user info, ID document URLs, and collateral data from Supabase/PostgreSQL
   - Use signed URLs for displaying uploaded images
   - Ensure updates (approve/reject) update all relevant tables:
       • loans (status, approved_at, approved_by, rejection_reason)
       • user_id_documents (status, verified_by, verified_at, rejection_reason)
       • loan_collaterals (verification_status, appraisal_status, appraised_value)
   - Log all admin actions in audit_logs for tracking

4. UI/UX:
   - Professional, clean, and responsive design
   - Step indicators or tabs to navigate multi-step loan details
   - Highlight pending approvals for quick action
   - Provide inline validation when entering appraisal values or rejection reasons
   - Mobile and desktop friendly

5. Optional Enhancements:

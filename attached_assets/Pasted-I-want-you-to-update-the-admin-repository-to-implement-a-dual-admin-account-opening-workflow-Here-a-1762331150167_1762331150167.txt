I want you to update the admin repository to implement a dual-admin account opening workflow. Here are the requirements:

1. **Application Approval Admin**:
   - Admin can view all user-submitted applications.
   - Show all details including:
     - Personal info
     - ID documents from Supabase storage (front and back)
     - Chosen account type and card preferences
   - Admin can approve or reject the application.
     - Approving creates a pending account in the database with status `pending_application`.
     - If the account type has a minimum deposit, record the min_deposit in the account.
   - Rejection allows admin to input a rejection reason.

2. **Account Approval & Activation Admin**:
   - Admin can view all accounts in `pending_application` or `pending_funding`.
   - Display:
     - User info
     - Account type
     - Min deposit amount (if required)
     - Current balance deposited
     - Status of minimum deposit
   - Actions:
     - **Approve account**: For accounts without min deposit, immediately set status → `active`. For accounts with min deposit, set status → `pending_funding`.
     - **Activate account**: Only enabled when min deposit is fully received. Sets status → `active` and marks funding confirmed.
     - **Reject account**: Optional, marks account as `rejected` with reason.
   - Update admin dashboard for crypto deposits:
     - Show if the minimum deposit for opening an account has been received.
     - Prevent activation until min deposit confirmed.

3. **Audit & Logging**:
   - Log all admin actions (approvals, rejections, activations) in `audit_logs` and relevant tables.
   - Track who approved applications, accounts, and confirmed funding.

4. **UI/UX Requirements**:
   - Clearly separate Application Admin and Account Admin dashboards.
   - Highlight accounts needing minimum deposit.
   - Provide actionable buttons: Approve, Activate, Reject.
   - Show dynamic status updates when crypto deposits are confirmed.

Use the existing table schema for applications, accounts, admin_profiles, crypto_deposits, and audit_logs. Ensure proper foreign key references and status updates. The workflow should enforce that accounts with minimum deposits cannot be activated until the required deposit is fully received.

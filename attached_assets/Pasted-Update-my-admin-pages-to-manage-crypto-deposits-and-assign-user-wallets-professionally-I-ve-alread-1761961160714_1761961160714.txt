Update my admin pages to manage crypto deposits and assign user wallets professionally.

I‚Äôve already added SQL columns and tables for crypto_deposits, user_crypto_wallets, and admin_assigned_wallets as shown below.
Make sure my admin dashboard is fully connected to them.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Core Requirements

1. Create a new admin page:
üìÅ /admin/manage-crypto-wallets.js
This page should allow admins to:
	‚Ä¢	View all users.
	‚Ä¢	Assign crypto wallets to each user manually.
	‚Ä¢	Choose:
	‚Ä¢	Crypto type (BTC, USDT, ETH, BNB, SOL, TON)
	‚Ä¢	Network type (depends on the crypto)
	‚Ä¢	Wallet address
	‚Ä¢	On save:
	‚Ä¢	Insert or update a record in admin_assigned_wallets
	‚Ä¢	Update or insert in user_crypto_wallets
	‚Ä¢	Log the action in audit_log if available (optional)
	‚Ä¢	Show success message: ‚ÄúWallet assigned successfully to [user_name].‚Äù

‚∏ª

2. Update /admin/manage-crypto-deposits.js

Admins should be able to:
	‚Ä¢	View all crypto deposits from crypto_deposits table.
	‚Ä¢	Filter by status: pending, confirmed, approved.
	‚Ä¢	View details:
	‚Ä¢	User name / email
	‚Ä¢	Crypto type
	‚Ä¢	Network type
	‚Ä¢	Amount
	‚Ä¢	Transaction hash (if available)
	‚Ä¢	Confirmations
	‚Ä¢	Deposit date
	‚Ä¢	Actions:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Approve Deposit:
	‚Ä¢	Change status ‚Üí approved
	‚Ä¢	Set approved_by = current admin ID
	‚Ä¢	Set approved_at = NOW()
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Reject Deposit:
	‚Ä¢	Change status ‚Üí rejected
	‚Ä¢	Add optional note
	‚Ä¢	Once approved, it should credit the user‚Äôs account balance using the same function already used by fiat deposits.

‚∏ª

3. Improve /admin/view-user-details.js

Add a new ‚ÄúCrypto Wallets‚Äù section under each user:
	‚Ä¢	Show all wallets assigned to that user from user_crypto_wallets.
	‚Ä¢	Include columns:
	‚Ä¢	Crypto Type
	‚Ä¢	Network Type
	‚Ä¢	Wallet Address
	‚Ä¢	Assigned By
	‚Ä¢	Created / Updated At

üí° Additional Notes
	‚Ä¢	Use the same styling and layout as other admin pages.
	‚Ä¢	Fetch all crypto deposits and wallets using Supabase.
	‚Ä¢	When an admin assigns a wallet, it should automatically reflect in the user-facing deposit page.
	‚Ä¢	If no wallet is assigned for a selected crypto/network, the user should see a ‚ÄúWallet not yet assigned‚Äù message.
	‚Ä¢	Add toast notifications for success and failure.

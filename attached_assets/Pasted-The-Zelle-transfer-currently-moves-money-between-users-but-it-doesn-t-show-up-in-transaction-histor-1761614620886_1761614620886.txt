The Zelle transfer currently moves money between users, but it doesn‚Äôt show up in transaction history on the dashboard or account-details page.
Please update the Zelle transfer logic to record transaction history in both:
	‚Ä¢	zelle_transactions (already exists)
	‚Ä¢	transactions (main history table used by dashboard)

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Requirements

1Ô∏è‚É£ When a Zelle transfer is successful:
	‚Ä¢	Update balances in accounts (subtract sender, add receiver)
	‚Ä¢	Update zelle_transactions.status to 'completed' and processed_at = now()
	‚Ä¢	Insert a record for both users into transactions:

Sender transaction:

INSERT INTO transactions (user_id, account_id, type, amount, description, status)
VALUES (
  sender_id,
  sender_account_id,
  'ZELLE_TRANSFER_SENT',
  amount,
  'Zelle transfer to ' || recipient_name,
  'completed'
);

INSERT INTO transactions (user_id, account_id, type, amount, description, status)
VALUES (
  recipient_user_id,
  recipient_account_id,
  'ZELLE_TRANSFER_RECEIVED',
  amount,
  'Zelle transfer from ' || sender_name,
  'completed'
);


2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Zelle History Page
	‚Ä¢	Create /zelle-history under user dashboard.
	‚Ä¢	Fetch data from zelle_transactions joined with profiles:

SELECT z.*, p.first_name, p.last_name
FROM zelle_transactions z
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON z.recipient_user_id = p.id
WHERE z.sender_id = current_user_id OR ze z.recipient_user_id = current_user_id
ORDER BY z.created_at DESC;

‚Ä¢	Display:
	‚Ä¢	Recipient/Sender Name
	‚Ä¢	Amount
	‚Ä¢	Status
	‚Ä¢	Date
	‚Ä¢	Memo

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ Enhance Zelle Flow
	‚Ä¢	When the user types a recipient email, auto-fetch name from profiles where email = input_email.
	‚Ä¢	Before confirming transfer, send a verification code (OTP) to the sender‚Äôs email using Supabase email_queue.
	‚Ä¢	Require the user to enter the OTP to finalize the transaction.

‚∏ª

4Ô∏è‚É£ Add Barcode Scan Option (Optional)
	‚Ä¢	Add ‚ÄúScan QR / Barcode‚Äù button.
	‚Ä¢	Use the recipient‚Äôs encoded account info or email for quick pay.
	‚Ä¢	Example payload in QR: { "email": "recipient@email.com", "name": "John Doe" }.

‚∏ª

5Ô∏è‚É£ UI Improvements
	‚Ä¢	Color legend:
	‚Ä¢	Credit (received): green (#28a745)
	‚Ä¢	Debit (sent): red (#dc3545)
	‚Ä¢	Pending: orange (#fd7e14)
	‚Ä¢	Cancelled: gray (#6c757d)
	‚Ä¢	Reversal: purple (#6f42c1)
	‚Ä¢	Other: gold (#d4af37)
	‚Ä¢	Recent transactions and dashboard must display Zelle transfers as well (based on transactions.type LIKE '%ZELLE%').


Use the service role key for secure inserts into transactions.
	‚Ä¢	Make sure transactions and zelle_transactions both include UTC timestamps.

‚∏ª

üß© Bonus:

Add a small label on dashboard:
‚ÄúZelle transfer to [recipient_name] ‚Äî Completed‚Äù
or
‚ÄúZelle transfer from [sender_name] ‚Äî Completed‚Äù
